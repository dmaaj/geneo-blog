## Tasks

- User authentication to allow a user to login and logout and ensure that only the logged in user can create, edit and delete their own posts.
- It should be clear on the list of posts and also when viewing the post itself who authored each post.
- There should be a page to show all users and the number of posts each user has authored should also be listed here.
- Users should be able to comment on their own and other user's posts.
- There should be two user types with different access levels: 
  - Admin users who can manage the access level of all other users. They should be able to toggle the access that other specific users have to certain features. We would like you to include toggles for the ability to comment on posts, the ability to create posts and any other features you think should be turn-off able. Admin users should also be able to promote other users to admins.
  - Basic users whose access permissions are determined by the configuration options selected by an admin user.
